# Can Gus dance to that?

Simple shiny app that checks if [Gus Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/user/gustoonz) can dance to something. Not finished yet.

## Why?

I've noticed that when you mute the video "[I had a great day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUkxoREfiQQ)" and play some music different to what can be heard in the video it still fits to Gus dance almost every time. So I had the idea to write an app that checks if a track fits and, if thats the case, play the video while the track plays.

## How does it work?

The app uses Spotifys API to pull song metrics for "Boogie Wonderland" and then compares those to the song metrics of a song the user enters.
